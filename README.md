This was build with openFrameworks and TonicAudio.

Because the glm changes broke some addons I stayed on an older OF version for this project (https://git.io/v1W1d). You will need the following addons: ofxRay, ofxFontStash, ofxMidi, ofxTonic and ofxXmlSettings if you want to build it. This will compile for iOS and OSX, you just need to rename the ofApp.* files. 

I will probably add some more usefull comments or a short documentation later. :sweat:
